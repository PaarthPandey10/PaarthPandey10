## 🧠 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity and computer science enthusiast currently building a strong foundation in:

- Network Security, Penetration Testing, and Malware Analysis
- Cloud & XDR-based Security (Trend Micro Vision One)
- Programming in Python, SQL, and Linux/Windows CLI
- Real-world security projects via Coursera, internships, and self-practice

I believe in hands-on learning through structured paths, side projects, and continuous certifications.
